                <h3 class="my-2">Workplaces stuck in antiquated views around ‘how we work’ are driving a disconnect
                </h3>
                <p>
                    With attendees attaining only 10% of what they’re learning during leadership coaching programs,
                    what’s the
                    motivation for companies to continue to put out billions (a whopping $356 billion annually,
                    globally) into
                    training? Are they pinning their hopes that maybe this time it will stick, following the footsteps
                    of other
                    organizations by “keeping up with Jones’s” so to speak or just blissfully unaware of what
                    contributes to long
                    term and lasting change, which ultimately is up to the program facilitator to present.

                    With the workplace landscape changing rapidly and leaders who are paving the way with new ideas, I
                    can’t help
                    but also notice some deeply rooted and archaic views on “how we work” and wonder just how far back
                    those views
                    go and why it’s a struggle for some to let go of.

                    I recall sitting in a meeting where a CEO had just undergone a surgery and had some complications in
                    the days
                    following the procedure. During the team meet she was applauded by the co-founder for ‘sticking it
                    out’ and
                    continuing to work despite her emergency situation.

                    Adam Grant, Author and Organizational Psychologist says;

                    “ Working when you’re sick is not a symbol of commitment. It’s a symptom of a sick culture. In toxic
                    workplaces,
                    rest is a sign of weakness. You’re expected to sacrifice yourself for the job. In healthy cultures,
                    rest is a
                    source of strength. Wellness is vital to doing your job.”

                    Now, think about the message that the leaders sent their wider team that day. Commitment at all
                    costs, even when
                    you should be resting. These are the organizations that will fall behind as more and more leaders
                    with a fluid
                    intelligence leadership style continue to create companies that are people first.

                    But how many companies are actually ready for this leadership approach change and are they even
                    aware of their
                    antiquated approach to the workplace? They didn’t create it, after all.

                    In 1920 (102 years ago) Henry Ford created the 9–5 or the 40 hour work week to protect assembly line
                    workers at
                    a time when the world was in a heavy manufacturing phase. So, if this is still the status quo, how
                    many other
                    workplace ideas are we clinging to that are a century old? A CENTURY OLD!!!

                    What are leaders views on work, how was work discussed in their household, do they still work with
                    those deeply
                    held beliefs and if not what is their attachment to those beliefs?

                    I met Megan (name changed for privacy) who was the CTO for a publicly traded company and a very high
                    achiever in
                    all areas. With a young family and juggling the demands of frequent travel Megan hit burnout to the
                    point of
                    adrenal failure. Having already done so much personal work and having stepped back for her recovery
                    before we
                    met, I discovered on a call with her that the household belief towards work growing up was “no fun
                    until the
                    work is done”. Excavating this very personal learned viewpoint was a game changer for Megan and
                    ultimately what
                    lead her to lasting changes in her career and her life.

                    This is a perfect example of a deeper learning process, with the aide of a trained psychologist and
                    coach that
                    helped Megan to see her own deeply held beliefs that ultimately lead to her adrenal failure and make
                    drastic
                    changes to her leadership approach.

                    This learned message isn’t exactly anyone’s fault as we’ve seen a dramatic shift in our approach to
                    work from
                    generation to generation and I believe that this is leading to an internal leadership struggle; work
                    like you
                    were taught and at the same time think creatively and openly with a people first approach, leading
                    to the spiral
                    of shame when you’re unable to achieve one or the other or lack consistency by teetering on one side
                    and
                    sometimes the other.

                    So, what’s the approach if studies are showing us that our leadership style is heavily influenced by
                    our early
                    views on how we work? How can we extract, understand and make opportunities for people who have tons
                    of value
                    but are often asked to be a square peg in a round hole?

                    Could a workplace counsellor or psychologist be a step closer to putting people first so they can
                    perform at
                    their best or will we continue to invest billions of dollars annually to maintain the status quo?

                    Until next time,
